There are 4 mains documents I have been working on my code in:
- index.html
- help.html
- style.css (located in style folder)
- script.js (located in script folder)
All of the algorithm, and page logic is in script.js, with the other edited files being for UI.

The remaining files are either resources (like images or pdf) or libraries (like bootstrap and JQuery).
