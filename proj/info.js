        description: 'Based on my highschool\'s Pseudocode guidelines, I made an interpreter, which would run basic commands and actions, with the ability to download the code (and user\'s output). This challenged me to try and consider how to act as a interpreter, and gave me a greater understanding of how one works. The interpreter runs in Javascript, but is supported with it\'s own website (HTML and CSS).',
