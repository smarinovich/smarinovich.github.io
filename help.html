            <h4>Nature of Pseudocode and the Interpreter</h4>
            <p>Pseudocode is a in between language used by programmers, to replicate how code should work, in a way that
                any programer can understand (due to it not being attached to a direct language, and mimicking the
                english language).The Pseudocode Interpreter runs pseudocode based off the HSC Software Design and
                Development Course
                Specifications (details can be found <a href='files/sdd-course-specs.pdf#page=35'
                    target="_blank">here</a>).
                <!--Link to SDD course specifications, opening on the page with pseudocode-->
                <br>
                The Interpreter can only take integer (whole number) or string (words or phrases surrounded by
                "quotation marks") values. In order to have a space saved as a value, it needs to be replaced with an
                underscore '_'. A variable can be defined as any combination of letters, numbers and symbols, as long as
                it isn't only numbers. The Interpreter however can't run subprograms, and can only run a mainline
                program.
            </p>
            <h4>Syntax and Structures</h4>
            <p>
                <Strong>A Note on the Functions</Strong><br>
                You can not put the same function inside another one, Such as a WHILE loop inside a WHILE loop, or an IF
                statement inside an IF statement. If the interpreter is not giving an output, this could be the cause.
                <strong>BEGIN...END</strong><br>
                A program must have its beginning and ending defined. In order to do that in the Interpreter, the first
                line must read BEGIN, and the last line must read END. This is especially important when there are
                subprograms, so we know when the mainline and subprogram start and finish.<br>
                <strong>input, output</strong><br>
                The input statement allows for a value to be inputted and stored by a variable. It must be followed by
                the name of the variable that it is to be saved to. Output will send out a value. It can either be a
                string, integer, or a variable. It must be followed after the word output. Output statements also
                allow for manipulation of values. You can add strings ('hello' + 'world'), multiply strings by integers
                ('hello' * 2), or manipulate integers by adding (3 + 2), subtracting (3 - 2), multiplying (3 * 2),
                division (4 \ 2), or raise to a power (3 ^ 2). Note that division is represented by backslash '\'.<br>
                <strong>Variable declaration</strong><br>
                Variables can be declared without the input function. Similar to other coding languages a variable can
                be defined with equals '='. The name can't be purely numbers, and ideally should be letters, or a mix of
                both. The values that can be saved can either be integers or strings, which follow the same structure as
                mentioned above (integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, strings are words or phrases,
                surrounded by quotation marks (spaces must be replaced with underscores)).<br>
                <strong>Operators</strong><br>
                The operator can either be a equals (==) or not equal (!=) for strings, or equals (==), not equal (!=),
                greater than (>), greater than and equal (>=), less than (&lt;) or less than and equal (&lt;=) for
                integers.<br>
                <strong>IF Statement</strong><br>
                IF statements are used if a section of code is to be run if a condition is true. The first line must be
                written as IF <em>value operator value</em> THEN, with the 2 values being a variable. If 2
                comparisons are to be done in the same line, then AND or OR can be placed after the first comparison,
                to have a second, which will look like IF <em>value operator value</em> AND <em>value operator
                    value</em> THEN. The last line of the if statement (after the proceeding code that will run if the
                comparison
                is true), will be ENDIF. If you want to add code that will occur if the comparison returns false,
                then after the section of code that will run for the true result, add the line ELSE, then with the
                code for when the result is false. The program will only run 1 or the other, but not both.<br>
                <strong>CASEWHERE</strong><br>
                CASEWHERE, or multi-way selection, allows for multiple comparisons to happen sequentially. The first
                line must state CASEWHERE <em>value operator</em> with each proceeding line starting with
                <em>value</em>: The
                values can either be string, integer, or in a variable. The operators which are used are all the same
                as in IF statements, and the same as in other comparisons. There can also be an OTHERWISE: case, which
                will activate if no other cases have run. The OTHERWISE: case
                must be the last case, before the ENDCASE. After the case, the user can run one function, like an
                output. This is done to correspond with the HSC guidelines. After this one function has run, the code
                will then skip all other cases. The final line of CASEWHERE is ENDCASE, which will define when the
                statements have stopped.<br>
                <strong>WHILE loop</strong><br>
                A WHILE loop will repeat until a condition is met. A while loop is written as WHILE <em>value operator
                    value</em>, using the same values and operators as in other comparisons (like in IF and CASEWHERE).
                The while loop will repeat indefinitely until this condition returns false. After the first line, where
                the statement is declared, the following lines that are to be repeated are then written. The last line
                of this structure is ENDWHILE, which is placed at the end of the code that is to be repeated. If the
                variable at the top is not updated, then this loop will continue infinitely. The loop will not run the
                code unless the condition is true (giving this loop the name giving pretest loop).<br>
                <strong>REPEAT loop</strong><br>
                The REPEAT loop is the inverse of a WHILE loop, it will run the code, then break if the condition is
                true. It's also known as a post test loop, as it will test the condition after it has run through the
                code. The first line of the REPEAT loop is REPEAT, then the repeated code is on the following lines. The
                last line will read UNTIL <em>value operator value</em>, where the operators are the same set, and the
                value is either a string, integer or variable.<br>
                <strong>FOR loop</strong><br>
                A FOR loop will repeat a segment of code for a specified amount of time. The first line is written FOR
                <em>variable</em> = <em>value</em> TO <em>value</em> STEP <em>value</em>. All values must be integers.
                The loop will count up or down from the first value, until it reaches the second value, increasing or
                decreasing by the step value. The variable only exists inside this loop, and can be anywhere inside the
                loop. The last line of the must read NEXT <em>variable</em> with the same variable that was defined at
                the start.

            <h4>Common Errors</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Runtime Error - The code is missing</strong><br>
                This error occurs if the code entry is left as blank, and you pushed the button to try run it. <br>
                <strong>Syntax Error - Missing BEGIN or END statement</strong><br>
                If the BEGIN and END are both in the code, then there could be an extra line after the END. Delete all
                the
                blank lines until the END is the last line.<br>
                <strong>Type Error - Invalid Data Type manipulation</strong> <br>
                Normally occurs in output or variable manipulation lines. This error occurs if the comparison is wrong,
                like multiplying a string by a string, or subtracting strings, or performing a comparison that isn't
                supported.<br>
                <strong>Math Error - Can't divide by 0</strong><br>
                Something is being divided by 0. If the 0 can't be seen, then it might be a variable that is secretly
                updated in a FOR loop, or from an input.<br>
                <strong>Unknown Value - Did Not enter a known value for an Int, String or Variable</strong><br>
                The value that was entered was not a valid integer, or string or variable. Ensure that all strings are
                surrounded by quotation marks (either both single or double), integers are whole numbers, positive or
                negative, and that the variable is mentioned somewhere else (through input or declaration).<br>
                <strong>Unknown Operator - Operator enter was not a known value</strong><br>
                The Operator that was entered was not a valid operator. The only valid operators are equals (==) and not
                equals (!=) for strings and equals (==) no equals (!=) greater than (>) greater than and equal (>=) less
                than (&lt;) and less than and equal (&lt;=). <br>
                <strong>Syntax Error - Missing Keywords</strong> <br>
                Missing a keyword in a structure. This could be THEN, in a IF statement, or Missing cases in CASEWHERE
                (where every line inside should have a different case indicate with colons), or Missing a closing
                statement, like ENDIF, ENDWHILE, REPEAT, NEXT <em>variable</em>, or ENDCASE. This can also occur if the
                user has created a function inside of another, where both are the same type of function.<br>
                <strong>Type Error - Invalid comparison statement</strong><br>
                This occurs when you're comparing 2 things that can't be compared like a string and an integer.<br>
                <strong>Syntax Error - Unknown Keywords or phrases</strong><br>
                The word or phrase that was typed in is not a valid keyword or phrase, and can't be understood by the
                Interpreter. Other options include forgetting a space between words, or having a function inside another
                function (like a WHILE loop in another WHILE loop).<br>
                <strong>Other Errors</strong><br>
                Other key errors that can arise will look like you are getting a blank output, and no actual result.
                There are 2 possibilities that can occur, either missing a space, or having an infinite loop. If the
                page is unresponsive, write down your code somewhere, and close the page. If the space is missing, try
                to find it, and rerun the program.

            <h4>Download Function</h4>
            <p>
                On the home page, there is a download function, on by clicking on the 'Download Code', a pop up will
                appear which allows you to download the code. There are 3 options. Cancel (which closes the pop up),
                Download Just Code (downloads all the code and closes pop up), Download Code and Result (downloads both
                the code and output, and closes pop up). All the downloaded files will be .txt files, labelled with
                date and downloaded version (starts counting with each new download). You can't download code without
                having text in the code section, and the code can't be downloaded unless the code hasn't been run.
